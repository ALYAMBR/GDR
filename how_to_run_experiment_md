Put `experiment_config.py` in the `gdr` directory.
Then execute line by line in terminal openned in this directory:
(You can skip this step if all requirments are installed already)
```
.\install_requirments
```
Now run experiment
```
python ./gdr/run_benchmark.py
```
Archive folder `experiments` after finishing and send it. Thank you!
